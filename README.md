## Material Color Picker

---

this is a small application for your dock that has  
all of the material design colors to choose from  
it also includes a custom color picker and both of them  
allow you to pick the type of color code to copy.

at this time it is only optimized for linux but i will soon work on getting it working with windows.

to install this you can just grab the .deb file from  
release-builds/installers
